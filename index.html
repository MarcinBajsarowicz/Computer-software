            <em>Computer software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and perform specific tasks. It enables hardware to function and execute various operations, from basic calculations to complex simulations. Software is classified into two primary types: system software, which includes operating systems like Windows and Linux, and application software, which helps users perform tasks such as word processing, web browsing, and graphic design. Over the years, the rapid evolution of software has transformed industries and created new possibilities in fields like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and cybersecurity. As technology advances, the role of software continues to expand, making it an essential element of modern life.</em>
